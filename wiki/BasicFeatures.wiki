*Enclosed Area* (A):
The area enclosed by the outer contour of the blob.

*Perimeter* (P):
The perimeter of outer contur of the blob.

*Perimeter of the convex hull* (H):
The perimeter of the convex hull of the blob

*Cicularity*:
Defined as P^2 / A. Has its minimum for a perfect circle by 4*PI

*Thinnes Ratio*:
Inverse proportional to the circularity. Furthermore it is normed. It is defined as: 4 `*`PI`*`(A/P^2)

*Area/Perimeter Ratio*: Defined as A/P

*Temperatur of the outer contour*: Defined as https://dl.dropbox.com/u/560426/imagej/temp.gif. It has a strong relationship to the fractal dimension. For further information see `[`1`]`.

*Fractal Box Dimension*: Estimated fractal dimension by the box count algorithm. The default Box-Sizes are "2,3,4,6,8,12,16,32,64". For other sizes you can use the method "getFractalBoxDimension(int`[``]` sizes)". Where sizes is an ordered array of the box sizes.

*Holes*: The number of holes. More specifically, the number of internal contours of a blob.
