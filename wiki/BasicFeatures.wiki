*Enclosed Area* (A):
The area enclosed by the outer contour of the blob.

*Perimeter* (P):
The perimeter of outer contur of the blob.

*Perimeter of the convex hull* (H):
The perimeter of the convex hull of the blob

*Cicularity*:
Defined as P^2 / A. Has its minimum for a perfect circle by 4*PI

*Thinnes Ratio*:
Invers proportional to the circularity. Furthermore it is normed. It is defined as: 4 `*`PI`*`(A/P^2)

Area/Perimeter Ratio: Defined as A/P

Temperatur of the outer contour: Defined as https://dl.dropbox.com/u/560426/imagej/temp.gif
