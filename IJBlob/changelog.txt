Changelog

==V 1.3==
* Add getMinimumBoundingRectangle (rotating calipers)
* Add getShortSideMBR
* Add getLongSideMBR
* Use Image Calibration
* Minor Bugfixes

==V 1.2.1==
* Removed bug by generation of labeled image

==V 1.1.1==
* ManyBlobs.java: A the feature for toggle the background/object color (black/white): setBackground() (Issue 2)
* ManyBlobs.java: Add the feature for getting a blob which encompasses a point: getSpecificBlob(x,y) (Issue 3)
* Some Refactoring
* Minor Bugfixes

==V 1.1==
* Add Getter: getLabeledImage();
* Add Blob Filter: ManyBlobs.filterBlobs();
* Remove some unnecessary library dependencies.

==V 1.0.6==
* BugFix: Drawing-Method draws the outer contour imprecise
* BugFix: Wrong values for fractal dimension
* Add "Ferret Diameter" as Basic Feature
* The Area is now calculated based on the freeman chain code
* The perimeter is now calculated based on the freeman chain code
* Due to improved perimeter and area algorithms the circularity and thinnes ratio are much more consistent!
* Elongation is now calculated based on a fitted ellipse instead of eigenvalues and therefore much more faster
* Remove Option "Calculate Elongation" (see above)
